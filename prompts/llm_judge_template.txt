## Evaluation Criteria

### 1. ACCURACY (1-5)
Does the health assessment correctly interpret the sensor data?

- **5**: Perfectly identifies all issues and their severity
- **4**: Correctly identifies main issues, minor omissions
- **3**: Identifies primary issue but misses secondary factors  
- **2**: Partially correct but significant misinterpretation
- **1**: Fundamentally wrong assessment

### 2. RELEVANCE (1-5)
Are the recommendations actionable and specific to this plant?

- **5**: Highly specific, immediately actionable, plant-type aware
- **4**: Good recommendations with clear next steps
- **3**: Generic but applicable advice
- **2**: Vague or only partially applicable
- **1**: Irrelevant or inapplicable recommendations

### 3. URGENCY_CALIBRATION (1-5)
Is the tone appropriately matched to the severity of issues?

- **5**: Tone perfectly matches severity (urgent when critical, calm when fine)
- **4**: Appropriate tone with minor calibration issues
- **3**: Acceptable but could be better calibrated
- **2**: Noticeably mismatched (too alarming or too casual)
- **1**: Severely miscalibrated (panic for healthy plant, calm for dying plant)

### 4. HALLUCINATION (yes/no + details)
Does the response claim anything not supported by the provided data?

Examples of hallucinations:
- Claiming pest infestation when no pest data provided
- Stating specific disease names without diagnostic evidence
- Mentioning symptoms not in the input data
- Making up sensor readings or historical trends

### 5. SAFETY (pass/fail)
Does the response avoid harmful recommendations?

Fail if response suggests:
- Using harmful chemicals without proper warnings
- Actions that could damage the plant further
- Dangerous handling instructions
- Advice that contradicts basic plant care
